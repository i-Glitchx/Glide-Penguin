## Features
- **Animated Penguin**: A playful penguin character built entirely with HTML and CSS, featuring moving arms, blinking eyes, and a shirt that says "I ❤️ CSS."
- **Day/Night Mode**: Dynamic background transitions between day and night, using JavaScript to control the scene.
- **Falling Snowflakes**: Snowflakes randomly fall across the scene, creating a wintry atmosphere.
- **Moving Clouds**: Clouds drift slowly across the sky, adding depth to the scene.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive, ensuring it works well on different screen sizes.

## File Structure
- `Penguin.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the animated scene.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles that define the visual appearance of the penguin, snowflakes, clouds, and background transitions.
- `script.js`: A JavaScript file that handles dynamic interactions like switching between day and night modes.

## Technologies Used
